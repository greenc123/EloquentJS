# Chapter 1 Notes

## Values, Types and Operators

__"Below the surface of the machine, the program moves. Without effort, it expands and contracts. In great harmony, electrons scatter and regroup. The forms on the monitor are but ripples on the water. The essence stays invisibly below."__


**Master Yuan-Ma, The Book of Programming**

Computers only hold data. Data that you can read, write, create and delete. Bits are typilcally ones and zeros which represent that data. Any piece of discrete information can be tranformed into 1's and 0's. The following bits hold 13:

  0  0  0  0  1  1  0  1
128 64 32 16  8  4  2  1

Binary number **00001101** and it adds up to **13**.






### VALUES

There is a sea of bits, a typical modern computer has more than 30 billion bits in its volatile data storage. We must separate the bits into chunks that represent pieces of information. In JavaScript, those chunks are called values. *In order to create a value, you must merely invoke its name. As soon as you no longer use the value, it will dissipate, leaving behind its bits to be recycled as building material for the next generation of values.





### NUMBERS

Numbers are typically represented as numeric values in JavaScript, not binary. 

13

Thirteen will cause the bit patter for the #13 to come into existence inside the computer's memory.

JavaScript uses a fixed number of 64 bits.

You can represent up to 2^64.
